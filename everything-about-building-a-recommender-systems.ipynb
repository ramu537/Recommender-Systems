    " The main objective of this kernel is make sure even a naive person without having much of ml knowledge can understand what was going and after completing this notebook i am confident that you can build your own recommender models using ml.Be confident and don't bother by seeing the size of this notebook it contains pure simple language so everyone can understand it......I explained each and every step of  model building... So please spend time and try it complete it ....If there are any suggestions you can mention it in comments and in the middle of the notebook you will some links please checkout those links also......\n",

    "   In this kernel we'll be building a baseline Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset.\n",
    "            \n",
    "   **Lets start**\n",
    "           There are mainly three kinds of recommender systems:-\n",
    "           \n",
    "  **1)<h1>Demographic Filtering</h1>**- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n",
    "           When we open some app in our phone it asks to access our location.Based on our location and people around it will recommend the things which we may like and this is basic recommender present in any application.\n",
    "           \n",
    "  **2)<h1>Content Based Filtering</h1>**- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n",
    "            This can be seen in applications like Netflix,Facebook Watch etc..,. which recommend us the next movie or video based on the director,hero etc..,.\n",
    "            \n",
    "  **3)<h1>Collaborative Filtering</h1>**- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.\n",
    "            This is the most sophisticated personalized recommendation that means it takes into account what user likes and not likes.\n",
    "            The main example for this is Google Ads.\n"

    "**Collaborative Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she/he is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers. It is basically of two types:-\n",
    "\n",
    "**User based filtering**- These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Item Based Collaborative Filtering** - Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. The major difference is that, with item-based collaborative filtering, we fill in the blank vertically, as oppose to the horizontal manner that user-based CF does\n",

    "Item based CF successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. However, several problems remain for this method. First, the main issue is scalability. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is **O**(mn) with m users and n items. In addition, sparsity is another concern.In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SINGLE VALUED DECOMPOSITION**\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to handle the scalability and sparsity issue created by CF is to leverage a **latent factor model** to capture the similarity between users and items. Essentially, we want to turn the recommendation problem into an optimization problem. We can view it as how good we are in predicting the rating for items given a user. One common metric is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The lower the RMSE, the better the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now talking about latent factor you might be wondering what is it ?It is a broad idea which describes a property or concept that a user or an item have. For instance, for music, latent factor can refer to the genre that the music belongs to. SVD decreases the dimension of the utility matrix by extracting its latent factors. Essentially, we map each user and each item into a latent space with dimension r. Therefore, it helps us better understand the relationship between users and items as they become directly comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here what it does is it coverts the matrix users vs products into two:-\n",
    "\n",
    "It divides into two matrices in such a way that users will mapped into some r factors and the products is also mapped to same r factors\n",
    "so they are going to map to same\n",

While demographic filtering is very elemantary and cannot be used practically, Content based recommender are used in the filtered searching based on some filter we asked for like action genre movies like that and the collaborative recommender systems are more personalized and those are used for improving the user experience. This model was very baseline and only provides a fundamental framework to start with.And you have all the knowledge required to build to recommender system..."
